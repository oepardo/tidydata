This repo was created by Olivier Pardo as part of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course final assignment

Aims
The aims of this project were to generate a tidy dataset out of an initial dataset accessible from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and reshape it to enable easier data interpretation.
A script was written in R to enable these operation and is available here under the name run_analysis.R
This script was generated in answers to the assignment requirements.
Assignment requirements
.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Strategy details
Details of the strategy used to meet the assignment requirements are available as part of the appended CodeBook.MD file.
